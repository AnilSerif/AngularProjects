# AngularFlix
It's an angular project that I made small changes on my own.

## Updates
- I updated the db.json fake API, which includes the newly created parts and the ones present in the old version, and renamed it to AngularFlix.json in AngularFlix project.
- The white background present in the old versions has been changed. You can make request operations with the help of Postman.
- Used the following technologies and libraries:
  - Bootstrap
  - Bootstrap.Icon
  - SwiperJs
  - AlertifyJs
  - Animate.style.css
